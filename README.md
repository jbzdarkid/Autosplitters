# Autosplitters
Speedrunners like to have splits to keep track of how well they're doing, compared to previous runs. Autosplitters facilitate this by splitting *for* the runner, so they can focus their attention on the game. Unfortunately, these do not spring from the ground fully formed, they have to be written! I've been slowly amassing a few of these that I wrote, and I'm collecting them here so I don't lose track of them all.
